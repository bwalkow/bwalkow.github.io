## Profile
As an advanced DevOps engineer with two years of experience managing Kubernetes-based systems, monitoring, I have solid expertise in automating deployment processes, and maintaining modern, scalable runtime environments. I have extensive experience in implementing and managing NLP projects based on CPU as well as GPU. I am no stranger to scaling solutions such as automatic horizontal scaling as well as graphics card configuration using MIG technology.

I specialise in Kubernetes cluster management, deployment automation using tools such as Helm, GitLab CI/CD, and application containerisation using Docker. In the course of my work, I have learnt a lot of solutions useful in the field of deployment process management among which are S3 databases (MinIO), MongoDB databases, Argo CD, FastAPI.
